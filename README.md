# FrontEnd Projects

These are self study frontend projects that I've completed to gain more experience using frontend technologies such as: CSS (Flexbox, Grid, Materialize), HTML and Javascript etc.  For some of the above projects I completed challenges on: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges to gain even more experience with frontend technologies and design concepts.
